# My Static Site

This is a static website project deployed on Cloudflare Pages. The project includes an automatic script that generates an `index.html` file listing all HTML files in the `hw` folder. Every time the repository is updated, Cloudflare Pages rebuilds and redeploys the site.

## Project Structure

```
my-static-site/
├── hw/
│   ├── hw1_question1.html
│   ├── hw1_question2.html
│   └── hw1_question3.html
├── scripts/
│   └── generateIndex.js  # Script to generate index.html
├── index.html            # Main page generated by the script
└── package.json          # Project dependencies and build script
```

- **`hw/`**: Folder containing HTML files.
- **`scripts/generateIndex.js`**: Script that reads files in the `hw` folder and generates `index.html` with links to each file.
- **`index.html`**: Main page that lists all files in the `hw` folder (generated automatically).
- **`package.json`**: Specifies the build command to generate `index.html` before deployment.

## Deployment

This site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and automatically redeploys when changes are pushed to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository.

### Build and Deployment Process

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - The `generateIndex.js` script is executed to create or update `index.html` with the latest list of files in the `hw` folder.

2. **Output Directory**: `/`
   - The generated `index.html` is placed in the root directory so that Cloudflare Pages can serve it as the main page.

### Local Development

To test or develop locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chenming00/yknCompFin.git
   cd yknCompFin
   ```

2. Install Node.js if it is not installed.

3. Run the build script to generate `index.html`:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the list of files in the `hw` folder.
